## About the Project

Six Strings is a comprehensive web application for guitarists of any level. The project helps to learn chords, scales, build chord progressions, and understand music theory. I built it for myself, for my own needs, but decided to make it available to everyone.

## Key Features

### Rhythm Trainer
!["Rhythm Trainer"](/images/portfolio/en/six-strings/rhythm-trainer.png "Rhythm Trainer")

This [trainer](https://sixstringsapp.com/#/en/rhythm-trainer) is based on Benny Greb's rhythmic alphabet. It helps develop a sense of rhythm and internal pulse for guitarists and other musicians.

### Rhythm Generator

Creates an infinite number of unique rhythmic patterns based on selected style and complexity. An excellent tool for practice and improvisation. Try it [here](https://sixstringsapp.com/#/en/rhythm-generator).

### Harmony
{{< image-gallery gallery_dir="/images/portfolio/en/six-strings/harmony" >}}

This section allows you to study harmony, tonalities, and modes. By selecting a key, you can see all the chords and scales that belong to it. Each chord can be played back. Additionally, you can listen to common chord progressions in the selected key.

Music often uses modulations - transitions from one key to another. This section includes a library of popular modulations with examples and explanations.

The main feature of this section is the "Song Builder". With it, you can create your own chord progressions, listen to them, and save them for future use. MIDI file export allows you to use the created progressions in digital audio workstations (DAWs).

### Chord, Scale, and Arpeggio Fingering Search
{{< image-gallery gallery_dir="/images/portfolio/en/six-strings/chords" >}}

This section allows you to quickly find chords, scales, and arpeggio fingerings on the guitar fretboard. You can select the type of chord or scale and see all possible variations. Each variation can be played back and its position on the fretboard can be viewed. For each chord, the "Arpeggios" tab shows fingerings in different positions. The "Scales" tab displays all compatible scales that can be used to play over the selected chord. Additionally, you can select a guitar tuning and see how the chord or scale will look in that tuning.

Find the fingering you need [here](https://sixstringsapp.com/#/en/chords).


### Fretboard Explorer

This [section](https://sixstringsapp.com/#/en/scales-fretboard-explorer?root=E&mode=chord&display=intervals&chord=maj7&chordCat=seventh) helps you study the guitar fretboard. Choose a guitar tuning and display notes or intervals to study chords and scales.

### Chord Identifier

Saw a guitarist playing a chord but don't know what it's called? Or maybe you experimented, found a cool sound, but don't know how to write it down to share with friends? Enter the chord notes into [this tool](https://sixstringsapp.com/#/en/chord-identifier) and find out its possible name.
