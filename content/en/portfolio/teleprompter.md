## Description

Web Teleprompter is a simple tool that helps with video recording or presentation delivery. It allows you to read text from the screen that smoothly scrolls at an adjustable speed.

I built it for myself to facilitate the video recording process for my YouTube channel and presentations at meetups. I decided to make it available to everyone who might need it.
